As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly,typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (pmid"},

Laryngeal atresia manifests as acute airway obstruction in the newborn immediately following clamping of the umbilical cord and is fatal without immediate airway management with a tracheotomy. Congenital laryngeal atresia is a rare anomaly that is mostly incompatible with life. Most authors claim that this malformation is related to an arrest of the sixth brachial arch at different gestational stages during normal embryologic development. Complete laryngeal atresia results in a desperate emergency during the first few moments of life,and surgical intervention must occur within 2 to 5 minutes of birth to enable respiration.

HPO","comment":"Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin,1991). Similarly,mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al,1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud,rather than a primary duplication event. In other words,the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al,1995). Finally,the multiple hand definormity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA."},

Intramembranous ossification refers to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone,and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g.,frontals,parietals,interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification,the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate,which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification,including those at the base of the skull,the vertebral column,pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance,reduced ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously,but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display normal ossification at a later developmental stage.

It is regarded as a non-specific marker and is thought to be involved in Coenzyme A interactions and lipogenesis within the brain. It is a marker of neuronal viability. Normal NAA concentration is in the range of 8-9 mmol/kg in healthy adult brain. Concentrations are decreased in conditions leading to axonal injury or neuronal loss. NAA is also decreased in other conditions such as neoplasm,infarction,and inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. NAA peak is seen at 2.0 ppm (parts per million) on MR spectra."},

This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects,but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development,the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses,or sinusoids,occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life,proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected,but biventricular noncompaction has been reported,with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle,several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction pmid"},

A high TIBC corresponds to a high transferrin concentration. The latent (or free) iron binding capacity is the difference between the TIBC and the measured serum iron,corresponding to the transferrin not bound to iron,i.e.,free iron binding capacity. PMID","comment":"Iron is transported to body tissues by a protein,transferrin,in plasma. This protein has two high-affinity binding sites for iron. Determination of total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of the plasma therefore gives a measure of transferrin,although it can also be directly determined. Virtually all plasma iron (P1) normally is bound to transferrin,and measurement of P1 is assumed to reflect the amount of transferrin iron. The expression transferrin saturation,expressed as percent (P1/TIBC) x 100,indicates the availability of iron to tissues. As transferrin saturation increases,there is an increase in the amount of diferric transferrin,which has a greater capacity to deliver iron than does monoferric transferrin. Measurements of P1,TIBC,and transferrin saturation have served several purposes in clinical medicine. The P1 concentration and (particularly) transferrin saturation relect the adequacy of iron supply. A saturation of less than 16% indicates a definicient iron supply,whereas a saturation of over 60% as measured on more than one occasion represents excessive iron loading owing to increased iron absorption or liver disease. An increased transferrmn concentration as reflected in the TIBC indicates iron depletion if the effects of estrogen and pregnancyare excluded. Other characteristic changes inboth P1 and TIBC are useful in the differential diagnosis of various diseases,for example,the decrease in transferrin saturations associated with a decreased transferrin concentration in inflammatory states."},

PMID","comment":"Two stages of podocyte foot process effacement (FPE) may clearly be distinguished. Within the first stage,foot processes undergo tremendous changes in shape,losing their regular interdigitating pattern and retracting into short irregularly shaped cell projections. Slit diaphragms are lost or displaced from their usual position at the base and replaced by occludens-type junctions between the definormed,broadened foot processes. These changes are necessarily associated with considerable movements of these processes in relation to the glomerular basemenet membrane (GBM). The second phase,the completed stage of FPE,includes retraction of the foot processes into the primary podocyte cell processes,leading to broad flattened disc-like projections that cover the GBM,finally merging with the cell bodies. At this point,the cell bodies have lost their usual position floating above the GBM within the filtrate in Bowman space. Instead they broadly adhere directly to the GBM.

From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease,and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments,a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimersdisease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic."},

The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause,and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However,as further characterization of this condition progressed,it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures,white matter pathways,as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus,the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer,and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature,the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous.

An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that develops out of ectodermal tissue and consists of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. An epidermal cyst may or may not be painful or release pus,and are usually noticed as a bump on the skin. Epidermal cysts and trichilemmal cysts are clinically indistinguishable. The wall of the epidermal cyst conserves the epidermal layers,but the wall of the trichilemmal cysts,which arise from the external root sheath,shows palisading of unlayered epithelial cells.
